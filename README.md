## Project Requirements

### 1- Presentations

Your presentation should include:

- Four slides

Please include a text file that includes each of the queries used to create the visualizations.

- All SQL queries run without errors and produce the intended results.
- Each SQL query needs to include one or more explicit join(s). - The query's JOIN or JOINs should be necessary to answer the question. If a question does not require a JOIN, please change the question to be one that does.
